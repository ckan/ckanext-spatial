            The eml-party module - People and organization information
          </title>
            <para>
            The eml-party module describes a responsible party 
            and is typically used to name the creator of a
            resource or metadata document. A responsible party may be 
			an individual person, an organization or a named position within
			an organization. The eml-party module contains detailed contact
            information. It is used throughout the other EML modules where
            detailed contact information is needed.
          </para>
            <para>
            The eml-party module, like other modules, may be
            "referenced" via the &lt;references&gt; tag.  This allows
            a party to be described once, and then used as a reference in
            other locations within the EML document via its ID.

            <para>The ResponsibleParty Type contains 
        elements that are used to describe the person, organization or
        position within an organization that is associated in some way with the
        resource. It is intended to be used to fully document contact
        information for many types of associations, such as owner, manager,
        steward, curator, etc.</para>
            <para>Note that the content model for a responsible party type 
        allows a sequence of choices for the first
        element(s): &lt;individualName&gt;, &lt;organizationName&gt; and/or &lt;positionName&gt;. 
        This means that a parent element (e.g., creator) may use combinations of the 3 sub-elements 
        to make up a single logical party. For example, a creator with only
                the individualName of 'Joe Smith' is NOT the same as a
                creator with the individualName of 'Joe Smith' and the
                organizationName of 'NSF'. To include both a positionName and
                 an organizationName as children of a &lt;contact&gt; implies that anyone 
                currently occupying that positionName at that organizationName 
                is an appropriate contact.
                The positionName should not be
                used in conjunction with individualName unless only that specific

        entire name.</para>
            <para> The two elements, &lt;givenName&gt;  and  &lt;surName&gt;,
             allow parsing of many types of names, even though distinct elements 
             do not exist for concepts like "middle name" and "compound surname".
        &lt;givenName&gt; should be used for parts of the name that are often
        shortened to a first initial, or are not used for ordering, and typically includes
        first and middle names.
        The &lt;surName&gt; field is intended to be used for the part of the name that
        is generally displayed in its entirety and/or is alphabetized or otherwise ordered
        when appropriate. Note that only one
        &lt;surName&gt; is allowed, and is required, while &lt;givenName&gt;s are 
       optional and unbounded.    </para>
            <para>The arrangement and content of the sub-elements is entirely 
       up to the EML document's author, who presumably has first-hand knowledge of 
       how the names are to be constructed. For example, if element position is important 
       (e.g., the list of a book's        authors), then
       EML authors should put the creators in that order. If it is appropriate for a
       resource to have its creators sorted alphabetically, then the EML author
       should construct the name parts so that the&lt;surName&gt; field may be used for
       this purpose. At this time, EML is not able to express cultural 
       conventions so that authors may indicate the correct order for 
       &lt;givenName&gt;s and &lt;surName&gt; when the whole name is expressed. 
       However support for international names
       is under consideration for a future version of 
       EML, along with other internationalization features.

            while it is possible  to include all given names in one field (as in the
            example below), it may be not be good practice to do so. For example, if an 
            XSL transformation stylesheet were to abbreviate the content of a 
            givenName to just the first initial, a givenName element that contained 
            more than one name would not be transformed correctly. </doc:description>
